This repo is for a java based servlet engine - 

Here, a Java class is provided that conforms to the “servlet” interface.  
When an HTTP request comes in, methods like “doGet” (for GET requests) and “doPost” (for, surprise surprise, POST requests) are called.  
The servlet engine supports only one web application at a time. 
Therefore, you can simply add the class files for the web application to the classpath when you invoke the engine from the command line, and pass the location of the web.xml file as an argument.
